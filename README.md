## `Question 1`
---
This program will take the temperature to calculate the voltage that would be displayed on a voltmeter or the voltage displayed on a voltmeter to calculate the temperature
## Compilation
Compile with
```bash
javac Thermometer.java
```
and run as
```bash
java Thermometer
```
## Output
The output will be two columns of numbers labelled T for Temperature and Vm for what the output of the voltmeter would be

---
## `Question 2`
---
This program will take the dimensions of a wooden beam and the maximum stress of the wooden beam in order to calculate the maximum stress that can be placed on the end
## Compilation

```bash
javac MaxLoadCalculator.java
```
and run as
```bash
java MaxLoadCalculator
```
## Output
The output will be the all of the entered information as well as the information that the program calculates

## `Question 3`
---
This program allows a user to enter the length and gauge of a wire and it will print what the resistance of that wire in copper as well as aluminum would be.
## Compilation
Compile with
```bash
javac CalcWireResistance.java
```
and run as
```bash
java CalcWireResistance
```
## Output
The output will be a quick summery of what the user entered as well as the resistance of the wire
